# gf180 0.1.1

GlobalFoundries 180nm MCU based on [Google open source PDK](https://github.com/google/globalfoundries-pdk-libs-gf180mcu_fd_pr)

This is a pure python implementation of the PDK.

## Installation

We recommend `uv`

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Installation for users

Use python3.10, 3.11 or 3.12. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE.

```
uv pip install cspdk --upgrade
```

Then you need to restart Klayout to make sure the new technology installed appears.

### Installation for contributors

For developers you need to `git clone` the GitHub repository, fork it, git add, git commit, git push and merge request your changes.

```
git clone https://github.com/gdsfactory/gf180.git
