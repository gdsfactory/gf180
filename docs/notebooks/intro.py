#
# ## Layout driven flow using gf180mcu (recommended)
#
# You should import the PDK from gf180mcu and layout any of the standard cells

# %%
# Recommended approach using gf180mcu directly
import gf180mcu

# Create components using gf180mcu
c = gf180mcu.diode_dw2ps()
c.plot()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Legacy approach using gf180 (deprecated)
#
# While still supported for backwards compatibility, this approach is deprecated and will show warnings:

# %%
# Legacy/deprecated approach (generates deprecation warning)
import gf180  # noqa

# This still works but is redirected to gf180mcu internally
c = gf180.diode_dw2ps()
c.plot()
